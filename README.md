# OOP - Team Project

## Project Overview
The **OOP - Team Project** is a collaborative effort showcasing core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++. It demonstrates the use of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction through a department management system, where employees, applicants, and customers interact within various organizational roles.

This project simulates a real-world scenario of managing multiple departments, handling applicants, hiring employees, and maintaining customer relations.

---

## Features
- **Department Management**: 
  Manage employees across multiple departments such as Technology and Sales.
- **Applicant System**: 
  Evaluate applicants based on their qualifications and hire them into appropriate roles.
- **Employee Roles**: 
  Support multiple employee roles including Managers, Developers, Sales Representatives, and Support Staff.
- **Customer Management**: 
  Maintain customer details and interactions.
- **Polymorphic Salaries**: 
  Dynamically calculate salaries for different roles based on bonuses, commissions, or base pay.

---

## Classes and Responsibilities
The project is structured with the following classes:

### Core Classes
1. **Person**:
   - Base class that represents a person with `name` and `age`.
   - Shared by all other classes.

2. **Employee**:
   - Abstract class that extends `Person`.
   - Represents an employee with an `id` and `baseSalary`.
   - Contains pure virtual methods for `salary()` and `display()`.

3. **Applicant**:
   - Extends `Person`.
   - Represents an applicant with details such as `degree`, `yearsExperience`, and `desiredPosition`.
   - Includes methods to validate qualifications (`isQualified()`).

4. **Customer**:
   - Extends `Person`.
   - Represents a customer with a `customerID` and `email`.

---

### Specialized Employee Roles
1. **Manager**:
   - Extends `Employee`.
   - Includes additional `bonus` and calculates total salary as `baseSalary + bonus`.

2. **Developer**:
   - Extends `Employee`.
   - Includes `projectBonus` and calculates total salary as `baseSalary + projectBonus`.

3. **SalesRepresentative**:
   - Extends `Employee`.
   - Includes `commission` and calculates total salary as `baseSalary + commission`.

4. **SupportStaff**:
   - Extends `Employee`.
   - Includes `shift` and calculates salary based on `baseSalary`.

---

### Department Class
- **Department**:
  - A templated class that manages employees and applicants.
  - Features:
    - `addEmployee`: Add employees to the department.
    - `addApplicant`: Add applicants after validating qualifications.
    - `hireApplicant`: Hire an applicant and convert them into an employee.
    - `displayApplicants`: Display all applicants in the department.
    - `showEmployees`: Display all employees in the department.

---

## How It Works
### Main Workflow (`main.cpp`)
1. Create departments (`techDept` and `salesDept`).
2. Add employees to each department:
   - Managers and Developers in the Technology Department.
   - Sales Representatives and Support Staff in the Sales Department.
3. Display employees in each department.
4. Create and display a customer.

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- Basic understanding of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ruxsoraxon/OOP---Team-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   g++ -o main *.cpp
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
